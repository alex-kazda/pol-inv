# pol-inv

The goal of this project is to allow one to use a Jupyter notebook (or a Python program) to investigate various properties of relational structures and algebras. 

Currently it can compute:
- Polymorphisms from a relational structure A to a relational structure B (see https://doi.org/10.1145/3457606)
