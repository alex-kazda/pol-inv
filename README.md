# pol-inv-sage

Right now this project is empty.

The goal of this project is to allow one to use Sage to investigate
- Polymorphisms from a relational structure A to a relational structure B (see https://doi.org/10.1145/3457606)
- Properties of universal algebras (similar to [Universal Algebra Calculator](https://github.com/UACalc/uacalcsrc), but in Python and taking advantage of multithreading)
